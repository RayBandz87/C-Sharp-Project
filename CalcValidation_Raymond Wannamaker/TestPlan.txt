These are some test procedures that the developed desktop C# Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) application might employ.

1. Verify that the form includes a "Steps Walked" label, a TextBox control for the user to enter the number of steps, a "Calculate" button, and three Label controls for the "Distance Walked", "Time Spent", and "Calories Burned" labels.

2. Enter a valid number of steps in the TextBox control, for example, 5000.

3. Click the "Calculate" button.

4. Verify that the calculated distance walked, time spent, and calories burned are displayed in the corresponding Label controls and are accurate based on the number of steps entered.

5. Enter an invalid value in the TextBox control, for example, "abc".

6. Click the "Calculate" button.

7. Verify that an error message is displayed using a MessageBox, informing the user that they need to enter a valid number of steps.

8. Close the error message.

9. Enter a valid number of steps in the TextBox control, for example, 10000.

10. Click the "Calculate" button.

11. Verify that the calculated distance walked, time spent, and calories burned are displayed in the corresponding Label controls and are accurate based on the number of steps entered.

12.Close the program.

These test steps should help ensure that the program functions correctly, including validating user input and displaying error messages when necessary.
