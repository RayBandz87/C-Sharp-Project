Input validation testing:
a. Test with valid input for radius (e.g., 5.5)
b. Test with invalid input for radius (e.g., "abc")
c. Test with empty input for radius

Calculation testing:
a. Test the calculated diameter value using a known radius value and compare with the expected value
b. Test the calculated circumference value using a known radius value and compare with the expected value
c. Test the calculated area value using a known radius value and compare with the expected value

User interface testing:
a. Test if the user interface is responsive
b. Test if the form displays the calculated values correctly in the respective text boxes
c. Test if the error message is displayed when invalid input is provided for radius

Performance testing:
a. Test with a large input value for radius and check if the calculation completes in a reasonable time

Compatibility testing:
a. Test the code on different versions of .NET framework to ensure compatibility

Security testing:
a. Test if the input validation is working as expected to prevent any security vulnerabilities.

Usability testing:
a. Test the application with a sample user and observe how easily he is able to navigate through the form.

Regression testing:
a. Test the code after any changes have been made to ensure that it still works correctly.
